# GameCo Marketing Strategy

Welcome to the GameCo Marketing Strategy project repository! Here, I delved into the world of global video game sales, aiming to provide GameCo with valuable insights for informed decision-making in game development and marketing.

## Objective
GameCo wanted to analyze historical video game sales across different regions, providing them with insights into market trends, popular genres, platform preferences, and regional sales. This will give GameCo better insight towards game development and future marketing strategies.

BUSINESS TASK:
Confirm if video game sales in North America, European Union, and Japan have remained the same over time.

OTHER KEY QUESTIONS
1. What genres are most popular/least popular?
2. What games for specific platforms are sold most?
3. Which region has the most video game sales?
4. What has the sales been like historically?

## Methodology

● Data Collection and Preparation: In Excel, I cleaned and wrangled the raw data.

● Exploratory Data Analysis: I used pivot tables, calculated fields, and visualizations to uncover trends and patterns.

● Customer Segmentation & Behavior: I analyzed regional sales behavior by segmenting the customer base to provide a nuanced understanding of market dynamics.


## Recommendations & Insights

Drawing from my analysis, I offered strategic recommendations to GameCo's Marketing team, suggesting budget allocation across regions and platforms to maximize sales potential. These insights give way for informed decision-making and strategic planning in the competitive landscape of the gaming industry.

## Technologies & Skills used

● Excel: for cleaning, summarizing, exploratory data analysis, and creating visualizations

● PowerPoint: for presenting the analysis, findings, and suggestions
